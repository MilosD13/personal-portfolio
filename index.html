							<h2>Book Radar <br>Full Stack</h2>
						</header>
						<img class="image fit" src="images/book-radar.jpg" alt="Book Radar" />
						<p>In collaboration with a colleague, we developed a comprehensive full-stack website leveraging the powerful capabilities of Blazor Web Assembly and .NET 8 frameworks. Our project stands out by integrating a robust Web API, which facilitates seamless interaction between the frontend and backend, ensuring a fluid user experience. We meticulously implemented JWT tokens to secure the application, providing a reliable system for authentication and authorization that supports multiple user roles. This differentiation of roles, including an advanced admin panel, allows for detailed management and control over the application's functionality and user access levels. The entire solution is hosted on Azure as a Software as a Service (SaaS) project, benefiting from Azure's scalable and secure cloud infrastructure. This setup not only enhances the application's performance but also simplifies the maintenance and deployment process torugh GitHub Actions, ensuring our project remains cutting-edge and efficient.</p>

									<h5>Cirque du Soleil - <i>Automation Globetrotter</i> </h5>
									<blockquote>I worked with Milos on the Cirque du Soliel show "Totem", 
										Where we were both responsible for the automation build in this incredibly busy show.
										I found in the short time I worked with him to be a very knowledgable worker 
										with a great passion for the job in hand. He is a friendly guy and seems
										to have a natural ability for communication and is very congenial.
										I really hope I get to work with him again soon.</blockquote>

									<h5>Cirque du Soleil - <i>Lighting / Video Technician</i> </h5>
									<blockquote>Milos is a super great guy first and foremost! He is your
									guy for just about anything. He isn't afraid to get his hands dirty,
									crawl into small spaces, or do things that might scare him. He is a
									very personable guy and loves to chat with anyone who approaches him.
									He keeps his cool during tense moments, and is eager to learn and improve
									his portfolio of skills at all times.</blockquote>

									<h5>Cirque du Soleil - <i>Electronic Maintenance Coordinator</i> </h5>
									<blockquote>I had the pleasure to work with MiloÅ¡ in Cirque du Soleilâ€™s show TOTEM
									in the Automation department and in many different improvement projects.
									It was a real pleasure to work with him as he is not only a good automation
									technician, fast learner, confident and good professional but also a great
									person to be with.</blockquote>

									<h5>Princess Cruises - <i>Live Entertainment Project Manager, specializing in theatrical automation, training & live show installations</i> </h5>
									<blockquote>I have known Milos for over 5 years and most recently worked with him on
									Princess Cruiseâ€™s largest show to date, Fantastic Journey. Earlier in Milosâ€™s
									career with Princess, his role was crew chief, as well as Automation operator. Milos
									quickly moved up in the ranks due to his passion to learn, work ethic, and  constant
									training. During this time as a crew chief I would often call upon Milos to assist
									our automation department with programming updates, paperwork, and maintenance checks.
									He was quick to assist, eager to do more and always came through when asked to go above
									and beyond his normal duties. Milos has a positive attitude and cheerful outlook on life,
									which translates into a supportive and productive team atmosphere.
									<br> <br>
									Working alongside Milos during Fantastic Journey was a pleasure. Milos not only brought his
									experience and professionalism to the team, but his positive attitude. His willingness to jump
									into any challenge sent his way, problem solve, and work independently as well as
									collaboratively was an asset to the team and the success of the installation.
